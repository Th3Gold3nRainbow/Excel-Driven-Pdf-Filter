## 🚀 How It Works



1.  **Input:** You provide a source PDF and an Excel file containing your list (e.g., a list of employees or invoice numbers).
2.  **Selection:** You select the specific column in the Excel file that matches the text present in the PDF pages.
3.  **Process:** The app scans every page of the PDF. If a value from your Excel list is found in the text of a page, that page is captured.
